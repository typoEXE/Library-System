# CPP Library System

## Overview

The CPP Library System is designed to streamline library operations by introducing an efficient item management system. Developed by Nathaniel Battad, Tyler Hipolito, Ryan Phan, Jeremy Po, and Erica Tan, this system focuses on improving data storage, loan management, and receipt generation for both library staff and patrons. It aims to replace the manual tracking and recording processes with a digital solution that enhances efficiency and user experience.

## Features

- **Efficient Data Management:** Streamlines the recording of books, films, and other items loaned, along with student details.
- **Automated Loan and Receipt Processing:** Automatically calculates loans, generates receipts for both students and staff, and supports financial reporting.
- **User-Friendly Navigation:** Designed with ease of use in mind, allowing staff to quickly navigate through the system.
- **Intelligent Reporting:** Facilitates the generation of revenue reports, offering insights into library operations.

## System to be

The envisioned system will allow library staff to:
- Efficiently record student and loan details.
- Register students and items easily for better bookkeeping.
- Create loans that automatically generate receipts for all parties involved.
- Manage operations more effectively, potentially incorporating intelligent revenue reporting.

## Requirements Specification

The system is designed to enhance data storage capabilities, automate the generation of loan information, and streamline receipt printing. It serves to maintain accurate records of loans made by students, providing easy access to necessary data for library staff.

## Assumptions

- Item reservations are outside the system's scope.
- User logins are not required for the current system version.
- The primary focus is on functionality, with GUI design considered afterward.
- Student ID numbers are recorded for easy tracking.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Class Creation:** Based on proposed models and diagrams, relevant classes are created.
2. **Database Development:** A database is set up to store and manage library data.
3. **Integration:** The system integrates classes with the database to ensure seamless data flow.
4. **GUI Development:** An intuitive graphical user interface is developed, linking input fields directly to the database.
